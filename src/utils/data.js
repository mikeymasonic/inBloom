As you listen to this soundscape and wander the ampitheater I invite you to think of the part of transformation when you are taking stock of what you’d like to change. Change is constant….something...something.  After the soundscape ends, take a moment to pause and listen without your headphones to the environment around you. Notice any sounds that arrive and disappear. Listen for at least 1 minute.',

At the time of year when the roses at the International Rose Test Garden are beginning to bloom, plants are generating extra energy. I have used a process called Biodata Sonification; attaching sensors to the plant\'s in the garden to collect their electrical impulses. You will hear these impulses translated into musical pitches and sounds that will guide you through the garden.',

  bio: 'Crystal Cortez is a sound, installation artist & programmer based out of Portland Oregon. She is also a professor of Creative Coding & Sonic Arts at Portland Community College. As someone who never saw herself represented in computer music or creative tech her work focuses on the empowerment of underserved populations gaining access and knowledge around technology. In 2019 she co founded whateverSpace, a maker space offering free and sliding scale workshops and technology rentals with priority going to the BIPOC community. Under her performance moniker Crystal Quartez she transforms field recordings, uses synthesis, audio programming, data sonification, and 3D sound spatialization to produce complex sonic realms. Her practice has recently involved the development of interactive sculptural interfaces and wearable technology that monitor movement and other corporeal methods to liberate the performer from their interfaces. Her art has been shown at NIME, PNCA, Disjecta, PICA, Navel (LA) and more.'
