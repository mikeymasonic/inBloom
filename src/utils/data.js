    description: 'The plant electricity data from this part of the garden came from an Ivy plant growing on the ground near the stage area. Its electrical pattern was dense and scattered. As you listen to this plant, I invite you to wander the amphitheater, pause, lay in the grass, and meditate on the germination stage of blooming. During this phase, a plant is going through extreme change, moving from seed to spore. Similarly, a large part of human transformation is taking stock of what you’d like to change. What does germination look like for you? How would you like to develop, reorganize, or expand?',

    description: 'The electrical impulses for the Royal Rosarian garden were taken from a rose called “White Licorice”. Its electrical pattern was chaotic, and covered a wide spectrum of frequency. As you listen to this rose, I invite you to meditate on the dispersal stage of blooming. This is the final stage of the flower life cycle, when it spreads its seeds to be planted. This begins the cycle again. Seeds are spread in many ways, from animal assistance to being carried off by the wind. This part of blooming invites us to think about where we’d like to go next and how we’d like to get there. What do you want to let go of in your next stage? Where do you want to spread your energy? In what places do you want to grow next?',

    description: 'For this part of the garden I took a reading of a rose called “Ring of Fire”, its electrical data had predictable up and down patterns. While you listen to this plant, I invite you to find a spot to rest and meditate on the growth stage of blooming. This rose’s impulses illustrate that growth isn’t always linear, steps forward are often followed by a confrontational step back. Looking at growth in a longer timeline, can we embrace the nonlinear nature of this process, especially when we lose momentum?',

    description: 'For the Shakespeare garden, I found a mystery plant off of the path to take a reading from. Its electrical pattern was the most linear of all my readings. It started with rapid signals and consistently became slower until it reached a resting pace. As you listen to this plant, I invite you to find a spot to pause and meditate on the reproduction stage of blooming. This is the point when flowers develop, and is the stage many of the roses in the garden are about to be in. Reproduction is about propelling forward in a chosen direction and ushering in new life. What new life do you want to bring in this spring? Where are you headed? How do you want to bloom?',

    description: 'The plant electricity performing the soundscape for this garden was called “Gemini Rose”. Its impulses were the most constant and evenly spaced of all the plant readings I took. As you relax in the Gold Medal Garden, I invite you to meditate on the pollination stage of blooming. There are two main types of pollination, self-pollination and cross-pollination. Pollination is a transfer of energy. This stage reminds us of the importance of transferring energy to the beings around us, but also back to ourselves. What versions of self-pollination and cross-pollination are you working on in your life right now? How can these relationships be strengthened?',

At the time of year when the roses at the International Rose Test Garden are beginning to bloom, plants are generating more electricity than usual. In my soundwalk, I have used a process called "Biodata Sonification", attaching sensors to the plants in the garden to collect their electrical impulses. I have translated these impulses into musical pitches and sound that make up half of the composition you will hear. The other half of the compositions are made up of field recordings collected in the space and added to the page throughout the month.

  bio: 'Crystal Cortez is a sound, installation artist & programmer based out of Portland Oregon. She is also a professor of Creative Coding & Sonic Arts at Portland Community College. As someone who never saw herself represented in computer music or creative tech her work focuses on the empowerment of underserved populations gaining access and knowledge around technology. In 2019 she co founded whateverSpace, a maker space offering free and sliding scale workshops and technology rentals with priority going to the BIPOC community. Under her performance moniker Crystal Quartez she transforms field recordings, uses synthesis, audio programming, data sonification, and 3D sound spatialization to produce complex sonic realms. Her practice has recently involved the development of interactive sculptural interfaces and wearable technology that monitor movement and other corporeal methods to liberate the performer from their interfaces. Her art has been shown at NIME, PNCA, Disjecta, PICA, Navel (LA) and more.'
